## üìñ Project Description
‚ú® **Problem Statement:** Numerous lives are put in danger when victims of cave-ins and other emergencies are stranded in precarious, restricted, and dangerous situations. Traditional rescue techniques are frequently made sluggish, risky, and perhaps impossible in these circumstances, making it hard for rescuers to reach survivors in time. What is desperately needed is a small, intelligent rover‚Äîa device that can traverse dangerous terrain, enter places that are off-limits to humans, quickly find survivors, and support rescue efforts. A system like this could revolutionize disaster response by increasing victims' odds of survival while lowering hazards¬†for¬†rescuers.  

üí° **Proposed Solution:** An advance ROVER,bionic hand assisted,with controllable actions and versatility.

üéØ **Target Users:** people trapped in caves,coal mines,construction areas.

## üî¨ Methodology
1. **Research & Ideation** : While going through newspaper,articles and reports, we often see the casualities due to limited tech-operated rescue.Our team worked on this problem and gone through many technologies associated with it.We took our inspiration from rovers used in planet exploration (where human intervention is minimum) and came up with BHARAT(Bionic Hand Assisted with Rescue and Advanced Technology‚Äã). 
2. **Design** : Our model is fully 3-D printed with a functionable bionic hand.A rover with camera and full mobility and equipped with sensors.
3. **Components** : RCWL Motion Detection,3D-printed components for the robotic hand,Sensor-embedded glove for teleoperation,Servo motors for hand articulation,Suitable power supply and microcontroller unit
4. **Technology** : ESP32-CAM Wireless Control and video feed
5. **Future Scope** ‚Äì Future plan of equipping it with high-tech sensors and robust materials.
